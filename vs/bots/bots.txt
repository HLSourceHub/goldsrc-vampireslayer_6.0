Vampire Slayer : Bots

The Bots have been developed using Bot Man's BotSDK, which provides an excellent framework leaving me much more time to concentrate on the mod specific code and AI. So big thanks to Bot Man for the many hours of my life saved :)=

I would describe the bots in Vampire Slayer : Chapter III as a good first beta release. Their behavior is best described as simple but good enough for many maps. The bots can be good practice for one player but the more human players in the server the better the bots will be especially if the number of human players is greater than the number of bots. 

Routetwo has added a bot forum (http://www.planethalflife.com/vampire/forum/) where you will be able to swap waypoints and bot tips etc. I'll be using this forum to put together a FAQ for all things bot related.

Bot Map Ratings

:) vs_yamamansion  - A most excellent map for large numbers of bots.
:| vs_capitol - Big ladders and some difficult jumps means some areas are difficult for the bots to reach.
:| vs_niteclub - Some problem areas round the bars and ladders.
:) vs_cemetery - Bring it on.
:) vs_quaint - Even the bots cannot deny the fun that is quaint.
:| vs_lynch - A nice simple map but with less players than bot the rounds become a little repetitive.
:) vs_hotel - The spread out vampire spawns points means the bots take many different routes through the map rather than the usual large mob attack.
:) vs_asylum - Insane.
:) vs_thebridge - Another simple but really quite fun map.
:( vs_school - Don't expect the bots to engage in the classic roof to roof net play.
:) vs_millstreet - The bots tend to gather in the living rooms (maybe they like TV) but with a few humans it plays much better.
:| vs_church - Problems with the bell tower but just don't go there.
:) vs_station - Needs a few humans otherwise it get a little repetitive.
:) vs_carpark - minor ladder trauma but a blood bath none the less.
:) vs_house - Problems with the coffins but a maze of death & blood.
:) vs_blade - As seen on the big screen.
:) vs_feint - Great!! One of the most playable and no ladders.

Advanced Server Options & Variables

Min Bots (server variable mp_minbots) - The server will add at least this many bots.
Max Bots (mp_maxbots) - The server will add up to this many bots. When mp_maxbots > mp_minbots the server will auto kick bots as real players joint the server
Bot Team (mp_botteam) - Auto (0) Bots will joint the team with the least players. Vampire (1) or Slayer (2) Bots will join the specified team. Good to co-op & team practice.

The add bot console command
vsbot add {team[vampire|slayer]} {class[fatherd|molly|louis|edgar|nina]} {name} {skill[0-5]}
eg. 
vsbot add
vsbot add pinback
vsbot add pinback vampire
vsbot add fatherd pinback 3
